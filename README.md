# AIA-Automator
An automation program designed to provide a free and open-source solution for automation needs. Designed to be used by those without programming experience, and to work on any program that supplies AutomationIDs to the program's built in controls.

Our project board is located <a href="https://github.com/WWU-AI-Association/AIA-Automator/projects/1">here</a>, if you'd like to contribute to the program, <a href="woodss9@wwu.edu">send me an email</a> and I'll give you access to the project, tutorials and a chat channel for better understanding.
